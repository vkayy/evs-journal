## motives

ev's journal is a passion project between my partner and i, where we aim to share our lessons in stoicism, relationships, and self-improvement with the rest of the world.

while being interested in tech, i've always had an affinity for philosophy and psychology, and this is one outlet for that.

## social links

socials are yet to be launched, but will include instagram, tiktok, discord, and patreon
